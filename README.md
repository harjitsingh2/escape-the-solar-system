# Escape the Solar System

## Background 
This project gives those who are curious about space the opportunity to explore our solar system. **Escape the Solar System** is a hybrid of a game and interactive demo where users are encouraged to learn and answer questions correctly about space facts.

Hop into our spaceship and explore the outer reaches of our solar system. Starting at Mercury, you must correctly answer questions to reach the next planet. If you answer three questions incorrectly, you must restart. When you reach the end of the solar system, you will officially become an interstellar explore and more surprises await.
